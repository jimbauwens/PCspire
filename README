How to use:

- Install Love (love2d.org)
- Create this directory:
Windows: %appdata%\Love\.pcspire
Linux  : ~/.local/share/love/.pcspire
Mac    : /Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/.pcspire

- Create another directory in there named "scripts" and place the scripts you
 want to run
- Then run "love path/to/the/dir/containing/this/readme"

You should see a window with a list of all the scripts you put in the .pcspire/scripts folder. Press enter to run it.
I know this is a bit complex, but it will become more easy in the future :) 

To enter the debug console press the "menu" button (next to Win/Mac/Meta key)
